<span style="color: black;font-size: 13px;">By Rebecca Gustafson</span>

<p>Hajji Rajaa is a 69-year old grandmother who lives on her own in Rif Damascus. As she was traveling to buy groceries for her family, she was hit in the knee by sniper fire.</p>

<p>Once the scene was deemed safe, bystanders transported Hajji Rajaa to a nearby USAID-funded field hospital. The medical team quickly determined the extent of the damage, thankful the bullet had not hit the femoral artery.</p>

<p>Doctors removed the bullet and treated her wound, but Hajji Rajaa required daily care to ensure her wound was healing properly. Though she wanted to recover at home with her family nearby, she was unable to travel to the field hospital due to the nature of her injury. The doctors, supported by USAID, decided to take turns visiting Hajji Rajaa every day to change her dressings and check the wound.</p>

<p>On their last visit to Hajji Rajaa, she told the head doctor that she wanted to thank him, his team at the field hospital, and the donors who provide the aid for the support that they offered her. She knew that without proper medical care, she would have lost her leg.</p>

<p>Thanks to the assistance provided by USAID, Hajji Rajaa will fully recover and be able to continue helping her children and grandchildren.</p>

<p>USAID medical programs in Syria provide medical supplies and equipment, pay doctors&#146; salaries, and train additional first responders and medical staff. More than 1.9 million patients have been treated and nearly 280,000 surgeries performed in more than 300 U.S.-supported hospitals and health clinics across Syria.</p>
