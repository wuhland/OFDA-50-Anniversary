<p>After Saddam Hussein's regime was toppled, a GOAL emergency response team entered the country on April 15, 2003 to become one of the first international aid organizations to respond to the needs of the Iraqi people.</p>
 
<p>With over $1.5 million from USAID&#146;s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), GOAL provided emergency humanitarian relief to war&ndash;affected communities in the governorates of Thiqar and AI&ndash;Muthanna, and in and around the southern city of Nasiriyah&mdash;the location of some of the fiercest battles of the war.</p>

GOAL carried out an assessment of the drug and equipment needs of 10 hospitals and 61 clinics in highly vulnerable regions. Afterward, in coordination with medical staff, our team repaired cold storage facilities, re&ndash;supplied the medical facilities with essential drugs and vaccines, and helped re&ndash;establish health information systems. By the completion of GOAL&#146;s program, the health facilities in Thiqar and AI&ndash;Muthanna had been greatly enhanced. The majority of clinics had sufficient supplies of drugs; staff were being paid; and patients were receiving vastly improved care.</p>

The war in Iraq also caused considerable destruction to water supplies and sanitation facilities in many towns and villages. It was commonplace for untreated sewage to flow into fresh water sources, creating obvious health risks. GOAL repaired water and sanitation systems at 10 hospitals and 61 clinics.</p>

<p>By October, all GOAL programs in Iraq were successfully completed. The 20 GOAL international staff left to return to their home countries and said goodbye to the over 100 local personnel that worked on GOAL&#146; programs.</p>

<p>Frank McManus, GOAL&#146;s Country Director for Iraq, was the last one to leave and remembers the day very vividly:

<blockquote>
<p>&#147;Funnily enough, my strongest memory of Iraq 2003, or at least the one that springs most readily to mind, is of leaving. Specifically, of saying goodbye to the GOAL staff just before the last of our cars pulled out and headed for the safety of Kuwait. The car in which I travelled to the border&mdash;the last to leave&mdash;was loaded with tacky, but well&ndash;meant goodbye gifts that our Iraqi colleagues had bought for us. One of these, taking pride of place on the dashboard as we travelled along, was a battery&ndash;powered, miniature disco ball that flashed constantly. It was a present from a young cleaner who, along with her mother (our cook) had been with GOAL for the entirety of our six&ndash;month program. Under the old regime in Iraq, the family had suffered more than most. Employment with GOAL meant that for, six months at least, they had been able to enjoy a much better lifestyle than before. Such as being able to afford decent food and clothing and to send the younger brothers to school. With GOAL leaving, the family faced the certain prospect of going back to barely scraping an existence. I still have the little disco ball.&#148;</p>
