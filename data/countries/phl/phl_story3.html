<p dir="ltr">The sheer destruction caused by <a href="http://www.usaid.gov/haiyan" target="_blank">Typhoon Haiyan</a> (known locally in the <a href="http://www.usaid.gov/crisis/philippines" target="_blank">Philippines</a> as Yolanda) is mind-boggling. Thousands were killed, countless homes were destroyed, and hundreds of thousands of Filipinos left homeless. Americans, and indeed people all over the world, were shocked by arresting images of a destroyed landscape and desperate people whose lives have been ruptured. While nothing can undo the damage wrought by the storm, the U.S. Government mounted a swift, large, and coordinated relief effort using all of the tools at our disposal, with USAID leading that humanitarian response.</p>

<p dir="ltr">While this was the<a href="http://www.usaid.gov/news-information/frontlines/open-development-development-defense/interagency-partnership-disaster" target="_blank"> fifth time since 2009</a> that USAID has been called to respond to a significant typhoon in the Philippines, it was by far the most devastating. It was also the first major disaster in my short tenure as Director of the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) and I was encouraged to see how the effort made a tangible difference in the lives of ordinary Filipinos. As aid began to reach tens of thousands of survivors, we were proud of our assistance to the Filipino people even as we were humbled by the breadth of the devastation. A few observations from my time in the Philippines:</p>


<ul>
	  <li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Preparedness and rapid response was critical. USAID/OFDA's hydro-meteorological expert had sounded the alarm about the storm well in advance, and so we were able to pre-position a disaster response advance team in Manila ahead of the typhoon. That team reached Leyte Island, the epicenter of the crisis, within 24 hours of the typhoon's passage. That team was on the first commercial vessel to reach the affected area and rapidly began to assess the areas hit by the storm and pinpoint the major priority needs. We found the immediate needs to be emergency shelter, water, and food and we have been working closely with our military colleagues to deliver much-needed assistance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	  <li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The damage is heartwrenching. Roughly 90 percent of structures are visibly damaged, including office buildings, hospitals, and homes. We saw severe damage to infrastructure systems, making access to water systems, communications systems, and transportation systems difficult. Weaker structures were totally destroyed but even hardened concrete structure suffered major damage in the ferocious storm surge.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Much more help will be needed. Immediately after <a href="http://www.usaid.gov/haiyan" target="_blank">Haiyan</a> hit, the United States offered <a href="http://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/nov-11-2013-statement-administrator-rajiv-shah-super-typhoon-haiyan" target="_blank">$20 million in humanitarian assistance</a>, which allowed us to distribute emergency shelter kits and family hygiene kits to the region. This is enabling us to reach 20,000 families with plastic sheeting for their homes, soap, toothbrushes, toilet paper, and sanitary supplies. Additionally, with the help of World Food Program, USAID has sent 55 metric tons of food, including highly nutritious bars and paste--containing a day's worth of calories--to nourish approximately 20,000 children and 15,000 adults for roughly four to five days.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">These were first steps, and in the weeks that followed we worked to help families meet their basic needs, regroup, and begin to recover. It was incredible to witness the unity of communities to offer help where they can. We also saw a major uptick in the volume of international aid to the Philippines as the global aid response reached full capacity. As more and more aid from the U.S. and many others - from countries to charities to individual donors - began to reach the Philippines, we were optimistic that the response effort would turn a corner.</p>
